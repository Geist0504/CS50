0.  The upper bounds of word character count in the English language. 
    A pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of very fine silicate or quartz dust
1.  getrusage returns resource usage measures for supplied process
2.  There are 16 variable
3.  So that rusage has a start point and an end point to calculate the usage stats between
4.  Main takes a text as it's third argument. It then initializes a pointer value & opens that text.
    A character array is intialized to a size 1 greater than the limit for word length in the language (english) to allow for the endo of string char \0
    A character is read from the text. If the character is a "proper" one (any letter or an apostrophe), it is appeneded to the array.
    If it is not, the loop skips to the next cycles through the remaining characters until it finds an end (EOF). 
    If the array exceeds the length of a potential word, the same consupmtion prcess occurs. Once the EOF flags without the other breaks
    we have found a word, '\0' is appended to end the string, it is counted, 
    checked for a mispelling and index is set to 0 to prepare for a new work
    
5.  fscanf must be supplied directives which indicate cases which to end the batch being scanned. 
    Without good control over the format of our inputs, there is risk we won't be able to supply all cases, leading to bugs
6.  We use constant so the value is immutable
